# AddressBook
A simple address book application built with AngularJS, Bootstrap, Lowdash, and FontAwesome.
The AddressBook is a small CRUD application. You can create, read, update, and delete contacts from an address boook. 
The data is hard-coded and is not persistent. It does not save to a database or any other backend. It's merely used for
demonstrating how one can use AngularJS to manipulate data from a CRUD perspective.

Requirements:<br>
Install GulpJS - https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md<br>

To run the application:<br>
1. Clone the AddressBook repo to your machine.<br>
2. Open a command prompt, and navigate to the location where you cloned the AddressBook project.<br>
3. Type gulp at your prompt. This should launch a local web server via BrowserSync at http://localhost:3000<br>
4. Enjoy!<br>

Note: Live reload is implemented using gulp file watchers and BrowserSync.  See: http://www.browsersync.io/
